abstract="The Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (PBO) and Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) problems are natural optimization extensions of Boolean Satisfiability (SAT). In the recent past, different algorithms have been proposed for PBO and for MaxSAT, despite the existence of straightforward mappings from PBO to MaxSAT, and vice-versa. This papers proposes Weighted Boolean Optimization (WBO), a new unified framework that aggregates and extends PBO and MaxSAT. In addition, the paper proposes a new unsatisfiability-based algorithm for WBO, based on recent unsatisfiability-based algorithms for MaxSAT. Besides standard MaxSAT, the new algorithm can also be used to solve weighted MaxSAT and PBO, handling pseudo-Boolean constraints either natively or by translation to clausal form. Experimental results illustrate that unsatisfiability-based algorithms for MaxSAT can be orders of magnitude more efficient than existing dedicated algorithms. Finally, the paper illustrates how other algorithms for either PBO or MaxSAT can be extended to WBO.",

abstract="This paper answers affirmatively the open question of the existence of a polynomial size CNF encoding of pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints such that generalized arc consistency (GAC) is maintained through unit propagation (UP). All previous encodings of PB constraints either did not allow UP to maintain GAC, or were of exponential size in the worst case. This paper presents an encoding that realizes both of the desired properties. From a theoretical point of view, this narrows the gap between the expressive power of clauses and the one of pseudo-Boolean constraints.",

  abstract = {In the mainstream adoption of free and open source software (FOSS),
distribution editors play a crucial role: they package, integrate and
distribute a wide variety of software, written in a variety of
languages, for a variety of purposes of unprecedented breadth.
Ensuring the quality of a FOSS distribution is a technical and
engineering challenge, owing to the size and complexity of these
distributions (tens of thousands of software packages). A number of
original topics for research arise from this challenge. This paper is
a gentle introduction to this new research area, and strives to
clearly and formally identify many of the desirable properties that
must be enjoyed by these distributions to ensure an acceptable quality
level.}
